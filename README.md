# WQQM-PIDU-V2.0

WQQM-PIDU model is a water quantity and quality model for paddy irrigation and drainage units, which can simulate water consumption by rice production and wastewater release. Detail information of the model theory and application examples are referred to a journal paper Li et al. (2020).

The files main_run.py, modules.py and sd_functions.py are the core scripts for WQQM-PIDU (V2.0).

The CJ1S-Hubei.py is an example script to run the model, with data_config.json as an example model parameter input file.

The two scripts in folder "WF and ISS analysis" are example post-analysis scripts that can calculate the water footprint (WF) and irrigation self-sufficiency (ISS) of rice-production systems with the modeling results.
